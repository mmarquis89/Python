1472310337583,Received,Yeah, out of the 2333 reviews only 4% were terrible so I'm hoping that's a good sign... idk I didn't want to spend 100 bucks on a shower head!
1472310449850,Received,Crap but that 4% really hated it ughhb
1472310713038,Received,Maaan why do I even bother. Is it better to buy something that has 33 perfect reviews or one with 2333 where 8% said it didn't work?
1472318644830,Sent,Hmm that's a tough one...I guess you'll have to go with your gut instinct about them!
1472320631344,Received,I just bought it and hoped for the best. Once my other roommates are here if it doesn't work maybe we can all go in on something

1472337124860,Sent,Who knows, maybe you'll become one!
1472599963797,Received,Have you ever watched Narcos?

1473251899216,Received,So... I was really tired this morning and forgot this umbrella was automatic open and totally broke it... do you think amazon would take it back and send

1473257301393,Sent,Hahah Julia that's ridiculous...and maybe, how long has it been since you got it?
1473260419215,Received,I KNOW IT WAS A SHAMEFUL MOMENT. Like a week? It's the first time it's rained!
1473260828821,Sent,Yeah I bet they would replace that for you then
1473262596508,Received,I'll send an email after class. I mean ordinarily I'd just shrug and buy a new one but it was so expensive... in the past amazon customer service has been good
1473263049797,Sent,Yeah I think as long as you gloss over the fact that you destroyed it's internal mechanisms with brute force they should replace it
1473264732382,Received,.... Like I said, not my proudest moment. In my defense I was really groggy!
1473373813689,Received,Guess who is going into the lab for the first time tomorrow??? Given how awesome my visit to your lab was you can only imagine my excitement!!

1473717623285,Received,So I'm like 99 percent sure my computer fan broke... is that really expensive to replace?
1473718194688,Sent,No I don't think it should be...you'll have to check with a repair place but I don't think fans are very expensive
1473719004492,Received,Ok... my roommate said hers was about 20 dollars but that the place she brought it to messed it up so I have to look for a place. An advice on where to go?
1473719973049,Sent,Hmm no I don't really know anything about various repair places...other than Best Buy? But I have no idea of they're good or not
1473720866583,Received,She said to avoid Do It, I'll see if I can find a Best Buy around here, it is where I originally brought it

1473807786679,Sent,Unfortunately I won't be around then...I think Saturday should work...worst case scenario we just have to take a break for a few minutes while I go switch out the slide haha
1473807830946,Received,Hahahaha ok I'll plan for that then! Or if this weekend is too bad for you we can try to work something out later in the week

1473808103899,Sent, I'm excited to hear them!
1474132194837,Sent,Hey let me know when you get to your room! My microscope time starts at 1:00 your time but there should be a good amount of downtime while it's imaging for me to Skype
1474135842109,Received,Sooo the bad news is that I can't check into my hotel room until 3 and the ceremony starts at 3:30 exactly 35 min away from it. So I'm currently in lewis
1474135843455,Received,ton aka the middle of nowhere. BUT my phone does have skyping capability

1474141025630,Received,Can I do that on my phone?
1474591876550,Received,So I have an article I'm reading for lab meeting next week and even though it's not my field it would be fun to try to contribute in some small way. Last
1474591877750,Received, time they said to pay special attention to the methods section but I don't really have any other methods in the area to compare these to.
1474591935575,Received,It's only a few pages, would you mind taking a quick look and just telling me some things to watch for? If you're too busy no worries, I am there to learn haha

1475345259565,Received,Perfect sounds good!

1475420979917,Received,Ok!

1476663952150,Received,It looks like we have a pretty bad connection and I know you want to talk to mom and dad as well, so maybe we should give up for now?
1476663986622,Received,It was really good to talk to you though! We should skype again soon
1476663991549,Sent,Yeah that's probably a good plan...it was great talking to you!

1477844841018,Sent,Oh I'm not sure...I had an actual picture but then my phone kind of froze up right as I was trying to post it and it somehow must have taken a new photo and posted that instead
1477844869452,Sent,Which was blurry and of the floor because I was just holding the phone in my hand
1477844910759,Received,Hahahaha oh no! I was kinda curious. Did you do anything halloweeny this weekend?

1477846103123,Sent,Hahah yeah I know that game...im struggling to get some work done today myself
1477847966371,Received,It doesn't help that my roommates are all younger than me and they rebound/recover so much faster and easier
1477847990396,Received,I didn't drink much last night though so mostly it's just sleep deprivation at this point
1477848057021,Sent,Yeah I think that's my main problem as well
1477848085241,Received,We can do it! I believe in us!

1479006016507,Sent,Okay cool! When would you estimate you'll be back from the gym?
1479007038527,Received,Kinda depends on when I get up haha. Is early better for you? I can go to the gym after, no biggie
1479011344655,Sent,I'm pretty flexible, I was just wondering for planning purposes
1479011360157,Sent,Maybe I'll just text you in the morning to check in?
1479011379803,Received,Ok! Sounds good!
1479060631412,Sent,Hey how would Skypeing in like a couple hours work for you?
1479061425610,Received,Yeah that would be good, I just got to the library about a half hour ago. Should we say 3:30 my time? Or 4? Or is that too late?

1479136461031,Received,This Is Acting? Or is there a newer one??!!! I'm kind of obsessed with Sia, she's amazing! I also really like her previous album 1000 Forms of Fear too,
1479136520821,Received,and We Are Born is pretty good too
1479143141302,Sent,Yeah This is Acting! I've listened to the other two a lot too,  but I think I like this one significantly better
1479144329471,Received,It's definitely the best one of the three, but I'd say they've been getting steadily better. We Are Born had a few good tracks, I actually think 1000 For
1479144340359,Received,I can't wait for her next one!
1479144387883,Received,ms of Fear was significantly better and then This is Acting is even a step up from there. She's a fantastic songwriter (and her voice!)
1479145016526,Sent,I kind of like the first two equally,  but I agree that musically it seems like all three are on a steady trajectory
1479145035844,Sent,Her vocals have definitely gotten more impressive throughout!
1479145332721,Received,I haven't listened to her really early stuff much, I'd be interested to. Also it would be fun to add in the myriad of songs she's written for other pop s
1479145392535,Received,tars and see how they fit in to her album evolution. Agreed, the woman's got pipes! I introduced mom to her, she really likes her as well

1480028543596,Sent,It does have that look to it haha
1480028612602,Received,It especially reminds me of when they did the archer crossover and he unexpectedly suddenly had the bobs burger 'stache
1480028823981,Sent,Haha yeah that was so awesome
1480028872951,Sent,When I first saw it I hadn't started watching Bob's Burgers so I doesn't fully get it though
1480029508715,Received,Yeah me neither but now I think it's hilarious
1480529957837,Received,I got to watch a perfusion in the lab today! Also the assistant lab manager said unofficially I could have a position there next semester
1480529979071,Received,Now I just have to convince Michelle Ciucci the PI
1480530007962,Received,And find like 6 extra hours in  the day
1480550324868,Sent,Oh wow that's cool! And if the lab manager is on board I'm sure Michelle wouldn't have a problem with it
1480551430820,Received,Haha I mean it's sort of the 3rd in line (assistant lab manager) but he does the scheduling and he was already talking about when I could potentially train
1480551452290,Received,So we'll see! I'm experiencing a little writers block with my email, I'm sort of in awe of her hahaha...
1480562028900,Sent,Haha yeah I still spend way too much time composing emails to people who probably look at them for like 5 seconds
1481128290581,Sent,Hahaha

1482089890818,Received,Also who was the giver?
1482090112229,Sent,I haven't settled on the name yet...the giver this year was another student in my lab, but he originally got it from a former postdoc in the lab at the same event last year,  who I think got it from one of his college professors
1482091718897,Received,But naturally he'll be your new best conversation partner. So he's been through several generations! This honestly feels like the beginning of a fantasy novel
1482091746133,Sent,Or a horror movie haha
1482091823123,Received,Hahaha I hope not! Maybe we should write the screenplay over break
1482091917265,Sent,Sounds like a summer blockbuster to me
1482092643063,Received,We'll be rich! Which famous actor will play you? Who will be the voice of the skull? So many important questions
1482092722460,Sent,I suggest Jesse Eisenberg for me and Morgan Freeman for the skull

1483163167575,Sent,Fading*
1483163176814,Sent,Maybe play some star realms...
1483163192018,Received,Hahaha I was going to say... facing? What is this new fad!
1483163215949,Received,Sounds good to me... minus the star realms of course but we shall see maybe you can convince me once I arrive

1485560851418,Received,I think she asked you a question in the post
1485560852855,Received,Like which one would win again
1485561500658,Sent,Yes! My comment was "Holy shit! Probably that huge fucking gator"

1487555452613,Received,Sure! That's what I've been using with them for a while
1487555481973,Received,Wait I'm not sure how to call another ipad, I always use mom's phone number
1487555950013,Sent,I'm sure we can figure it out
1487555984392,Sent,Also do you mind if I talk to Dad first? It might be kind of late for him afterwards
1487556678602,Received,Yeah just got off the phone with mom she said the same thing, do you think we could by 8:30 though? I'd kinda like to get to bed on the early side
1487557869570,Sent,Okay I'm ready now
1487557932362,Received,Ok me too
1488478661449,Received,On a scale of 1-10... what would be your reaction to me saying I am most likely getting another tattoo, possibly around spring break?
1488482901510,Sent,Depends on what it is haha
1488484646186,Received,It's the reboot of the mayan calendar, happens like every 8000 years, symbolizes the rebirth of the world
1488484716299,Sent,Looks pretty nice...what made you choose that?
1488484795884,Received,I like the idea of representing the rebirth of the world vs the end of the world. Also the Mayans had the most accurate calendar system of all ancient cultures
1488484839659,Received,Plus their glyph system is hugely complex and linguistically interesting... and also I think it just looks really cool... haha
1488485502474,Sent,Seems pretty cool to me! Where would you get it?
1488485993126,Received,I'm deciding between arm/shoulder area and above my ankle leg area. I'm kind of torn though. What do you think?
1488486023819,Received,I guess it depends on how small they can make it while maintaining detail
1488487257476,Sent,Hmm I could see either working okay...maybe a slight preference for arm/shoulder
1488491201814,Received,Maybe I can print one out and like hold it up to compare! Or during a consult they can do their thing where they like temp it on for you to see
1488491455585,Sent,Oh yeah you could have them do both haha
1488492143588,Received,That was my thinking! I'm at least going to get a consult over spring break, see how much it'll cost and where. But if I like what I hear I may just sit
1488492203554,Received,for it then and there haha
1488492703957,Sent,So decisive haha
1488492877481,Received,I try to choose these things very carefully and I consider the consequences first! I've never regretted once the two I got and I've waited a few years in
1488492879360,Received, between. This is going to be the last one I swear haha. Maybe I should wait until summer so you can get in on the action, still want those ants? 
1488492879887,Received,
1488493763270,Sent,Yeah, it's mostly just a matter of funding someone who could do it the way I want
1488496581767,Received,True. You'd need someone to draw it out for you, whereas I just need someone to follow the lines haha
1488496602917,Received,Most have portfolios which is nice
1488496655428,Received,Also, on a sidenote, I've gotten an audio cable for my piano and have been playing around with audacity quite a bit
1488496775679,Sent,Oh nice! Has it been working well for you?
1488496784955,Sent,I'm amazed you find the time haha
1488497568891,Received,Pretty much! Still feel like I barely understand how to use it haha... but it's fun! I can send you some of my preliminary stuff if you want
1488497630465,Received,It's shocking I know! Good time management I guess... got 97, 96, 93 and 100 on all my midterm assigments and tests (except the 1 I took today)!
1488498686699,Sent,Holy shit you're killing it again this semester! 
1488501037033,Received,So far so good, but I'm only halfway there! Honestly looking forward to spring break a lot haha
1488502775223,Sent,I bet! Got any fun plans?
1488503459137,Received,Nothing fun... I might house sit for mom and dad for a while while they're in Italy
1490416458367,Received,Sooo I don't know if you're watching any march madness games but holy shit... this uw madison/florida game has been INSANE
1490447276359,Sent,Oh man no I haven't been following it...I don't know who won so maybe I will try to find some highlights to watch on YouTube without seeing the score!
1490455546604,Received,Spoiler alert we lost and I'm bitter, but check out like the last 10 min of the game if you can find it, there was an overtime that nobody was expecting haha
1490459616145,Sent,Uhhhh you're lucky I already just went and watched it little miss spoilers
1490459632344,Sent,What an insane finish!
1490459735459,Received,Hahah I didn't describe exactly what happened or the scores! Just w
1490459738070,Received,anted you to know I was salty... 
1490459760209,Received,But at least it was a fantastic game to watch! Although it would have been a lot better if we'd won...
1490462827581,Sent,It was pretty epic wither way!
1490462834972,Sent,Either*
1490919740762,Received,Heyyyy brother! Was watching Angel, remembering when we used to watch it back in the day and started wondering when you're coming to visit.
1490923031092,Sent,Oh man I should rewatch some of that haha
1490923074490,Sent,I'm not sure yet...probably sometime in late July/early August if that works well for you!
1490923364984,Received,They're just as great the 2nd time around! I got Alyssa into Buffy so I've been rewatching those as well...
1490923449353,Received,Of course! I'll be here! I'm not finished with class until 8/10 but it's only mon-thurs in the morning so it shouldn't interfere too much
1490926984890,Sent,Okay cool! I'll let you know when I decide more specifically
1490993510207,Received,Great! Also, I just realized I'm turning 26 this year... how did this happen??!! When did we get old???
1490994901224,Sent,I think for me it was about four years ago
1490995903764,Received,Oops forgot you already are in your late 20s ahaha..
1490995905503,Received,Also there is a real chance I may actually forget how old I am soon
1490995917447,Received,25 was one thing... but 26?? I'm going to truly dread birthdays now. I'm almost in my late 20s!
1490996327157,Sent,I'M PUSHING 30
1490996897472,Received,Come on now you've got a few 20 bdays left! Besides, lots of people getting their PhD are in their 30s
1490998842181,Sent,True but they are all old too!
1490998857201,Sent,And two is not "a few"...
1490998871324,Sent,And in a few weeks I'll only have one left!
1490999453441,Received,Hahaha I was trying to undo the damage I had wrought... umm I've heard your 30s are your best years?
1490999471098,Received,Speaking of, do you have any plans for your birthday?
1491001963328,Sent,Trying to pretend it's not happening haha
1491002213881,Received,I'm finally starting to understand that impulse haha...
1491002223618,Received,But I wish I were there to bake you a cake!
1491004299034,Sent,Me too!
1491351499762,Sent,Thank you!! I still can't believe it but I'm very excited  Want to Skype sometime soon and catch up?

1491352864428,Sent,Yeah that should work for me! And tell them thanks for me!
1491673155557,Received,Hey! Did you want to Skype today or tomorrow? I think later today works slightly better for me but either way I can work around it!
1491687139013,Sent,Hey! I'm more flexible tomorrow but later tonight might work too depending on your schedule
1491687321296,Received,I'm just hanging out tonight, nothing specific! Tomorrow I can make work as well though, so no worries
1491700504531,Sent,Hey what times tomorrow would be best for you? I could talk tonight but I'm kind of exhausted and would probably be more fun to talk to tomorrow haha
1491701962691,Received,No worries! I totally get that.   Probably like 11-12 or 3-4ish? Or later on in the evening like 8? How about you?
1491702654417,Sent, I'm flexible! I'll probably try and talk with mom and dad in the evening, but I'll bring my iPad into lab so I can talk whenever during the day
1491702968812,Received,Cool! Would the 3ish time be ok then?
1491703168490,Sent,Yeah sure!
1491703192419,Received,Great, I'll plan for that!

1492276677676,Sent,Is that like a study guide or something?
1492277714224,Received,Yeah! It goes along with my aphasia tree/table that I've been making. The dysarthrias are next!
1492280174645,Sent,They're gonna have to give you an art degree as well haha
1492280767591,Received,Hahaha hardly. But when the creative mood strikes, I feel like I must be getting some knowledge out of it!

1494295749650,Sent,Just heard about your bike accident from mom and dad! How are you feeling?

1494296576870,Received, shoulder pain is just tendon damage so that's a relief. Getting my bike looked at tomorrow for repairs hopefully too
1494296769618,Sent,Eesh that sounds rough. Glad you weren't hurt more seriously though!

1495299127958,Received,Hey, I accidentally did something bad to the router and now it can't connect to the internet... can you call me when you get a chance?

1495304276860,Received,Yeah we have no idea what happened and the guy who set it up isn't free today... I pressed the wps reset button and now the network is intact inside the
1495304823901,Received,house (like the printer and computer wirelessly talk) but there's no access to outside internet sites
1495306711210,Sent,Hmm I'm on a hike right now but could call when we stop somewhere...I don't know if I'll be very helpful though...

1495318478934,Received,Oops dad informed me it's a chrysalis or something
1495337432683,Sent,Yeah I looked it up and they are called tent caterpillars! There were tons of them in a whole grove of trees
1495465762827,Received,Hey have you ever heard of Bonobo? I went to see them at 1st avenue last night and they reminded me a lot of disclosure
1495468684155,Sent,No! I'll have to check them out
1495593774807,Received,... mom had friends named "tanya tewel" and "john joy." Those weren't even on that list we made
1495597252232,Sent,Are you fucking kidding me
1495597541560,Sent,I'm starting to think she either a) is just making shit up or b) lived in some sort of weird Pleasantville situation
1495602174306,Received,!!! I KNOW RIGHT
1495602237856,Received,Honestly I'm leaning toward the pleasantville option, no one is that creative at making up names
1495605946348,Sent,Truth.
1495606412705,Received,She also said grandma used to literally stick her head out the back door and operatically SING her and her siblings names when she wanted them to come in
1495606843225,Sent, Omg that simultaneously so ridiculous and yet so not surprising
1495606851189,Sent,That is*
1495606937609,Received,I KNOW RIGHT??? She said they could hear it from blocks away...
1495606957842,Received,Anyway, had to share the ridiculousness
1495902889276,Received,Ohhh did you not know? Unsurprisingly I have already sampled them...
1495902929741,Received,My verdict was that the package was way too small!!
1495908499630,Sent,Hahah I should have known that you'd be on top of that
1495908571677,Sent,They are so delicious

1496015183192,Sent,Haha well I figured they  would for Denny, but I didn't know about anyone else

1496017252320,Sent,Oh really? I thought she didn't like it

1496091933515,Sent,How was your drive?
1496093347713,Received,Not bad at all! I made it home and it is a beautiful day out. The drive wasn't bad! A little rain, a little traffic, but nothing major

1496423796548,Received,I guess Saturday is supposed to be super rainy though, if I had to pick a day
1496429770483,Sent,Okay let's do that! I'll be doing a bunch of imaging during the day so I'll have some downtime in between slides
1496432778719,Received,Perfect! Just let me know when you're hanging out and good to talk!
1496436603686,Sent,Sounds good!
1496505549839,Received,Hey is it cool if I use you as one of my references on my FAFSA loan promissory note? I'm assuming you could give a positive character review if necessary
1496506640589,Sent,Yeah of course haha
1496524883739,Sent,Hey I ended up not having many breaks but am finishing up now so I'll be ready to talk in ~15 min...just let me know when you're ready!
1496524950311,Received,I'm just sitting like a bum on my bed reading right now so just text me when you're on your break!
1496526494733,Sent,Okay, I'm ready anytime
1496526555553,Received,Ok! I'll call you!
1497359034578,Received,I had a dream last night that you came to my friend Carly's picnic in Oconomowoc... it was really fun but you refused to go to your meeting the next morning
1497359056449,Received,Just thought you'd want to know the shenanigans your dream-self is pulling these days!
1497371179457,Sent,Hahaha I wish!
1497371208790,Sent,Also what the fuck is Oconomowoc??
1497371252538,Received,A city in Wisconsin, ostensibly?
1497379133146,Sent,It looks more like a typo haha
1497382322193,Received,Or transcription of a mumble haha... I'll send you photos when I get there on Saturday just to prove it's real
1497453845578,Received,Is it weird that I find some of the GHS symbols to be excellent tattoo ideas?
1497453865536,Received,Specifically the flammable, oxidizer, and health hazard warnings
1497454782881,Sent,Haha I guess not? If you think all of those concepts are important to you
1497454912687,Received,Haha I mean, I'm not heading to the tattoo shop as we speak or anything... I just had to go to this mandated chemical safety presentation at the lab yest
1497454918425,Received,erday and as the guy was talking I got distracted thinking about it
1497454919194,Received,OMG WE COULD GET MATCHING ONES
1497454970420,Received,I think "flammable" describes our sibling duo don't you?
1497455476970,Sent,Haha well technically I suppose it does
1497455514181,Sent,Not all that flammable in the grand scheme of things though haha
1497455567345,Received,... fine, you buzzkil! What do YOU want our matching tattoos to be?
1497455574411,Received,Are we oxidizers?
1497455645670,Sent,I'm not sure we fit very well into any of the official hazard categories lol
1497455686587,Sent,I actually think the biohazard symbol would probably be the most accurate
1497455982102,Received,Haha so true, an excellent plan! I'll scope out a place for when yo
1497455983372,Received,u visit in August 
1497460603737,Sent,Haha I'm not sure I'm ready for such an aggressive tattoo
1497461216171,Received,I vote we go back to being oxidizers then
1497461889988,Sent,Oxidizes are aggressive!
1497461902278,Sent,But I suppose the tattoo would be less so haha
1497461924675,Sent,Because of the nerd factor
1497462142712,Received,Maybe oxygen is the aggressive one! Haha yes, exactly!
1497820505724,Sent,Can you remind me of the dates in the time window when would be convenient for me to visit?
1497821867695,Received,Yeah! We'll be moving in on the 16th of August so any time between then and my orientation on the 28th would be ideal! But I don't actually start class u
1497821927542,Received,ntil the following week I think
1497822060221,Sent,Okay cool, thanks! Gonna book flights soon
1497822182622,Received,Yay!! Fingers crossed you get some good deals
1497891833356,Sent,Okay I'm leaving from Milwaukee on Aug 30th! I'll occupy myself somehow on the 28th while you're orientating
1497893098366,Received,Hooray! It's 28th and 29th actually, but I think the 29th might only be a half day? Also my roommates will probably be around to entertain you a little,
1497893159128,Received,and Joan wants to see you, and I can always drop you off at the captol or something so you can do some touristing. What day do you arrive??
1497894461541,Received,Damn, I just looked at my packet and it says orientation is through the 30th... worst case scenario there's a bus that goes from madison to milwaukee, an

1503599319189,Received,Hey so I get pretty terrible service here still but the building is called Medical Sciences, and the best place for us to meet would be the corner of Charter and Linden probably, at 5? Hope your new phone is all you wished it to be!
1503599702224,Received,Shit really? Sorry they did piercing so I thought they would! OK park and university it is! It's a huge intersection though so we'll have to be specific about which side of both streets
1503599880953,Sent,Yeah I was surprised! There are two more places right next to each other not too far from the terrace though, so hopefully one of them should have what I need

1504096990875,Received,Hahaha I guess I'm not really surprised, traveling is stressful and people lose things when they're stressed

1504200482249,Sent,Okay cool that's the one I have, thanks! Just thought I should make sure. I'm in lab but hopefully it will be waiting for me when I get home! 
1504200853694,Received,Yeah never hurts to check. Fingers crossed, let me know when it shows up!
1504200965053,Sent,

1506719431457,Received,SO I just had a brilliant idea... Not sure if I have the skills to pull it off, but I want to try
1506729149526,Sent,What?? 
1506731578832,Received,I should do my clinical fellowship in Boston!!!! We could live in the same city again for 9 months and I could come to your thesis defense!!! 
1506731617453,Sent,Omg that would be so amazing
1506731625585,Sent,Would that be good for you? 
1506731637004,Sent,Like, jobwise? 
1506733220992,Received,RIGHT?? I think so!! If I keep going along the medical track it would make sense because Boston is a big city and there'd be a lot of places to do it! 
1506733242657,Received,And as far as I know it's not one of the weird states that has extra requirements
1506744502398,Sent,Well I am heartily in favor!

1510523819272,Received,https://www.etsy.com/shop/KRCharcoalART
1510523851612,Received,I was thinking maybe the 45 dollar Sagrada familiar one! She's donating a percentage of her sales also! 
1510526183984,Sent,Yeah sure, that sounds good to me! 
1510526249028,Received,Cool! Did you take a look at the shop? If you like one of the other ones better we can do that instead, the Sagrada familia one is just my favorite!

1510534824985,Sent,I also like that one the best! 
1510535024196,Received,Cool! She says she can size it differently as well if we want but I thought to go with the smaller one since the larger one is $75 vs $45...  
1510536840767,Sent,How big are each of them? $75 isn't that much if we're splitting it so I think we should just get whichever size we think would be better
1510537731093,Received,According to her Etsy the bigger one is 15 x 20 and the smaller one is 11 x 14
1510539527792,Sent,Hmm what do you think? I any really picture what size seems better
1510539787717,Received,Honestly, no idea. My only thought is, they have so much stuff hanging up it might be easier to find place for a smaller piece? 
1510539795689,Received,But maybe the bigger one is better, I don't know! 
1510539818036,Received,Clearly I'm not an experienced art dealer...
1510539829693,Sent,  Yeah maybe the smaller one would be more flexible 
1510540174135,Received,Maybe so. Hmm so should I tell her we want to go with that one? 
1510540332168,Sent,Sure, that sounds good to me 
1510542204329,Received,Yay ok I'll let her know! 
1510542209513,Received,Mom's going to love it!
1510542231014,Sent,Yeah good find!
